<h2>Welcome to Zero 2 Hero.</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Zero 2 Hero is a score between 0 and 100 generated each day based on a combination of your current autonomic response, training status and intrinsic motivation, where 0 would indicate not able to train at all and 100 being you are at your peak for the World Championships.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your score does not change during the day, so undertaking strenuous or stressful activity prior to your planned training will impact the reliability of your score.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First step is to authorise your Today's Plan account.</p>
