<td>Zero 2 Hero is a readiness for training score between 0 and 100 generated each day based on a combination of your current autonomic response, training status and intrinsic motivation, where 0 would indicate not able to train at all and 100 being you are at your peak for the World Championships.</td>

<td>Your score does not change during the day, so undertaking strenuous or stressful activity prior to your planned training will impact the reliability of your score.</td>
